Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker.
Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved. These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I'll rest easier not knowing where they are. This is the worst part. The calm before the battle.

But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. We don't have a brig. I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan! Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head. Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9. 95 a minute.

Really?!
But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. Well, then good news! It's a suppository. Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head." Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file!

I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan!
Okay, I like a challenge.
I'm a thing.
Well I'da done better, but it's plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence.
What kind of a father would I be if I said no? Is the Space Pope reptilian!? Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase. It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too.

There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors!
Tell her she looks thin.

That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing. Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them.

You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit! Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker. They're like sex, except I'm having them! I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians.

Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets! I'm Santa Claus! Yeah, I do that with my stupidness. Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be.

Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file! And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you? No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don't own!

Hey, guess what you're accessories to. That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing. You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus?

I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself. We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera. Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. Why would a robot need to drink?
Guess again. Ooh, name it after me! Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo! Bender, quit destroying the universe! File not found.

Shut up and get to the point! I can explain. It's very valuable. It doesn't look so shiny to me. Oh Leela! You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only person who ever loved me. I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan!

I found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things. They're like sex, except I'm having them! Fry, we have a crate to deliver. I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually?

Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack! I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff! This is the worst part. The calm before the battle. Leela's gonna kill me. Bender, I didn't know you liked cooking. That's so cute.

You can see how I lived before I met you. Who are those horrible orange men? Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers? Throw her in the brig. Fatal. I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope?
