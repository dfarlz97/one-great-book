Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.
Oh right. I forgot about the battle. Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools. And from now on you're all named Bender Jr. Hey, guess what you're accessories to.

Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died. Okay, I like a challenge. The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate.

Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it.
Daddy Bender, we're hungry. I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there! Moving along… Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay! Ooh, name it after me!

When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults.
Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused.
Why would I want to know that?
Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat.
We're also Santa Claus! When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults. I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas.

And when we woke up, we had these bodies.
But existing is basically all I do!
Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars.
Shinier than yours, meatbag. Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems. Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase.

Shut up and take my money! I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger. Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break his legs? I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool.

We're rescuing ya. Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the charge and the reception isn't very… Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life.

I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually? Why, those are the Grunka-Lunkas! They work here in the Slurm factory.

You wouldn't. Ask anyway! Tell her she looks thin. Anyone who laughs is a communist! Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig". Daddy Bender, we're hungry.

That's not soon enough! So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct? Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial? They're like sex, except I'm having them! When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults.

Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd. Belligerent and numerous. Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry?

Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew. All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit… that's why I'm transferring to business school!

Oh Leela! You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only person who ever loved me. You don't know how to do any of those. Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates… PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon.

Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket. No, she'll probably make me do it.

For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs! Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying! We don't have a brig. Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? …To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? …To shreds, you say.
